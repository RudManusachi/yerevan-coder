This is the source code to the `yerevancoder.com` website.

It is a `nodejs`, `reactjs` based project.

# Local development

First `git clone` this repo, then run `npm install`. The latter
installs all the dependencies you need.  To start the local server, do
`nodemon src/server.js`. If that doesn't work then it probably means
you don't have `nodemon` installed. You need to install it globally,
do that with `npm install -g nodemon`.
